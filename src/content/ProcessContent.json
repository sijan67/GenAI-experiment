    "text": " First of all, from the model selection drop-down in Leonardo AI, one can choose the genAI model to generate an image with. We initially experimented with Stable Diffusion 2.1, Anime Pastel Dream models with a goal to generate an animation-style final image; however, these models did not work as expected. They generated outputs such as a person with cat headbands (1) or an image of just a tailored blazer and trousers without a cat (2). In contrast, the 3D Animation Style generated the expected Anime-style image with a cat. (3) \n<br> The prompt used for all of these models was the same, which is <b> ‘Envision a cat in a sophisticated power suit with a tailored blazer and high-waisted trousers. Choose a bold color like navy blue or charcoal gray to exude authority.’ </b> \n<br> However, we noticed that the generated image did not have any background related to the business world (3), as per our theme. So, we modified the prompt to add a background as: <b> ‘Envision a cat wearing a sophisticated power suit with a tailored blazer and high-waisted trousers. Choose a bold color like navy blue or charcoal gray to exude authority. Consider a background that showcases a blend of technology and innovation, reflecting the cat's forward-thinking approach to business.’ </b> This prompt generated a background, but it was just a blurry one. (4) \n<br> Therefore, we decided to make the prompt more concise and removed the choice of color, as: <b> ‘Envision a cat wearing a sophisticated power suit with a tailored blazer and high-waisted trousers. Consider a background that showcases a blend of technology and innovation, reflecting the cat's forward-thinking approach to business.’ </b> \n<br> And with this prompt, we were able to get the final result we expected.
